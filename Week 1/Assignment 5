Exploring the Interface

Here is a screenshot of the Google Colab interface with annotated key components and features:



- Notebook Toolbar: Contains buttons for common actions like saving, adding code cells, and running the notebook.
- Code Cell: Where you write and execute Python code.
- Markdown Cell: For writing text, explanations, and documentation.
- Runtime Information: Displays the current runtime type (e.g., CPU, GPU) and memory usage.
- File Explorer: Access and manage files within the notebook environment.
- Tools Menu: Provides options for changing runtime type, managing sessions, and more.

 Writing and Executing a Python Code Cell

1. Click on a code cell or add a new one by clicking the "+ Code" button.
2. Enter the following Python code to print a message:

   python
   print("Hello, Google Colab!")
  

3. Click the "Run" button (play icon) to execute the cell.
