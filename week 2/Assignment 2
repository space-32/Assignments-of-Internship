   - Command-line interface (CLI) and script execution.

3. An Informal Introduction to Python:
   - Basic data types: numbers, strings, lists.
   - Simple operations and expressions.

4. More Control Flow Tools:
   - Conditional statements (if, else, elif).
   - Loops (for, while).
   - Functions: defining and calling functions, parameter passing, and default arguments.
   - List comprehensions for concise and readable list processing.

5. Data Structures:
   - Detailed exploration of lists, including methods and slicing.
   - Introduction to other data structures: tuples, sets, dictionaries.
   - Looping techniques and using the `zip()` function.

6. Modules:
   - Creating and using modules.
   - The standard library: common modules and their uses.
   - `import` statement and package structure.

7. Input and Output:
   - Reading from and writing to files.
   - Standard input and output.
   - Formatted string literals and the `str.format()` method.

8. Errors and Exceptions:
   - Handling errors using try and except blocks.
   - Raising exceptions and custom exceptions.

9. Classes:
   - Basics of object-oriented programming in Python.
   - Defining classes and creating objects.
   - Inheritance, method overriding, and data encapsulation.

10. Standard Library:
    - Overview of Python's extensive standard library.
    - Key modules and their functionalities: `os`, `sys`, `math`, `datetime`, `json`, etc.

11. Virtual Environments and Packages:
    - Creating and managing virtual environments with `venv`.
    - Installing and using third-party packages with `pip`.

12. Brief Tour of the Standard Library:
